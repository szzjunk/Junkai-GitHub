Question:
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

Code:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT Logs1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM 
    Logs Logs1,     # Create 3 aliases for this table Logs
    Logs Logs2, 
    Logs Logs3
WHERE 
    Logs1.Id = Logs2.Id - 1    # Create a condition satisfying the requirements
    AND Logs2.Id = Logs3.Id - 1 
    AND Logs1.Num = Logs2.Num 
    AND Logs2.Num = Logs3.Num
;
