```

- The _**doc**_ folder contains all the code with documentation (integrated report with code).
  - If you just want to take a look at the report & code, double-click to open the HTML file
  - If you want to check the code (run it), open the ipynb file by jupyter notebook (Anaconda)
   - To successfully execute the code, the data path and ITCH filename need to be set up in the jupyter notebook, and the 01302019.NASDAQ_ITCH50 and message_types.xlsx need to be put into the data path
   
- The _**data**_ folder is supposed to store 01302019.NASDAQ_ITCH50 and message_types.xlsx. 

- The _**output**_ folder contains all HDF5 files generated by the code. Now it's empty.
  - itch.h5: stores the decoded binary messages from the ITCH 5.0 tick data
  - order_book.h5: stores the rebuilt order flow for the given day
  - vwap_store.h5: stores the VWAP of each stock

- The _**Use Batch File to Run Python Script as Program**_ folder contains a .bat file that can automatically use command prompt to call Python.exe and tranfer parameters into Python script for executing the .py file.
